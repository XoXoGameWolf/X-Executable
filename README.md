# X-Executable
My version of an executable, just with much smaller files.

This was programmed in python, using nothing other pygame and the standard packages.
I will be working on a X-Assembly language soon to help with programming in this.

In case you wanna just use a hex editor, every instruction is 3 bytes long, and you can use the instructions.txt
as a reference for the opcodes and syscalls.
